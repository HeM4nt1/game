Summary of Changes
1.   Global Variables: Added score, lives, and game_speed_ms.

2.   Main Loop Condition: Changed while (1) to while (lives > 0).

3.   Display: Added printf("SCORE: %d | LIVES: %d\n", score, lives); to display the stats.

4.   Score Increment: Added score += 10; inside the if (step > 10) block, rewarding the player for successfully dodging an obstacle.

5.   Difficulty Scaling: Added logic inside the loop to decrease game_speed_ms (making the game faster) when the score reaches 100 and 300.


6.  Collision Handling:

--Replaced the instant break; with a call to handle_collision_impact().

--The handle_collision_impact() function decrements lives, handles the sound, and only leads to a permanent end when lives reaches zero.

7.   Sleep Time: The Sleep(120); call is replaced with Sleep(game_speed_ms); to enable dynamic difficulty.
